## Analysis  
A detailed analysis of the dataset can be found in the model folder under a file named analysis.ipynb. This analysis dives into each of the variables and their significance with respect to the target variable. The target variable can take up three values: Diabetic, Pre-Diabetic and Non-Diabetic. The rest of the variables include blood measurements that correspond to the well-being of the patient. Based on the analysis, variables that do not contribute to the prediction of the target variable are removed and the remaining variables are used in the construction of the model.  
Since there are more than two possible outcomes and the data does not follow any linearity or normality consistently, we cannot use binary classifiers such as Logistic Regression for this dataset. Since there is a lot of differences among the variables and none of the pre-requisites are being satisfied, we turn to models that are highly flexible and can deal with the complexity of the dataset. We begin by testing the most basic model of such models called the Decision Tree Classifier. This model attempts to group data into a hierarchy of groups based on conditions or decisions that need to satisfied in order for the data point to fall under that particular group. This is done by calculating the extent of similarity in the data group. If the data points that fall in the group are greatly similar then we can call the group pure, if not then the group is said to be impure. There are metrics that can be used to calculate how pure or impure the group is, such as Entropy or Gini Index. Based off these metric the data is grouped to form a hierarchy of conditions or contraints for the data points to satsify so that they can fall to the right group.  
Our Decision Tree Classifier model scored a balanced accuracy score of 96.3% on the test data. This classifier is exported using this library called Pickle, stores a class instance with all states intact as it was when the class was converted using the package. It converts it into a binary file which can then be exported and used anywhere.  

## Website  
The website is built using ReactJS for the front-end and Flask for the back-end. It is a single page website which contains some basic information regarding Diabetes and a from that takes in user input regarding medical details. These details are thens sent to the back-end Flask server where the data received is formatted into a format that can be used as an input for our classifier. The result from the classifier is taken and sent back to the front-end as a result. This result is checked and a suitable user-friendly message is displayed based on the result.
